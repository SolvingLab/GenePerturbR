\title{Find Targets of Gene}
\usage{
gpdb_find_targets(
  gene,
  direction = c("both", "up", "down"),
  top_n = 50,
  min_confidence = "medium",
  min_effect_size = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{Character. Gene symbol to perturb (e.g., "TP53", "METTL3")}

\item{direction}{Character. Which targets to return:
\itemize{
  \item "both": Return both upregulated and downregulated targets (default)
  \item "up": Only genes INCREASED by knockdown
  \item "down": Only genes DECREASED by knockdown
}}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of top targets to return per direction (default 50)}

\item{min_confidence}{Character. Minimum evidence strength required:
\itemize{
  \item "high": Only relationships supported by 5+ datasets (most reliable)
  \item "medium": Include relationships with 2-4 datasets (default)
  \item "low": Include single-dataset observations (exploratory)
}}

\item{min_effect_size}{Numeric. Minimum absolute log2 fold change (default 0.5)}
}
\value{
Data frame or list with target genes and statistics
}
\description{
Identify which genes are affected when a gene is knocked out/down.
Returns genes that are significantly changed (padj < 0.05) across multiple datasets.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# What does METTL3 regulate? (returns separate lists)
targets <- gpdb_find_targets("METTL3", top_n = 30)
targets$upregulated # Genes upregulated by METTL3 knockdown
targets$downregulated # Genes downregulated by METTL3 knockdown

# Only strong effects
strong_targets <- gpdb_find_targets("TP53", min_effect_size = 1.5)
}
}
