\title{What Happens When a Gene is Knocked Out or Down}
\usage{
gpdb_what_happens(gene, context = NULL, aggregate = TRUE, top_n = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{Character. Gene symbol to query (e.g., "TP53", "METTL3")}

\item{context}{List. Optional filters to restrict analysis:
\itemize{
  \item cell_line: Specific cell line (e.g., "K-562", "HeLa")
  \item tissue: Specific tissue type (e.g., "Liver", "Lung")
}}

\item{aggregate}{Logical. Whether to return aggregated multi-dataset results (default TRUE)}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of top target genes to return (default 50)}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \itemize{
    \item summary: Natural language text summary
    \item top_upregulated: Genes increased by perturbation
    \item top_downregulated: Genes decreased by perturbation
    \item all_effects: Complete results
    \item stats: Statistics including n_datasets, consistency scores, etc.
  }

List with summary text, top targets, and statistics
}
\description{
Query the effects of gene perturbation aggregated across all available datasets.
Returns comprehensive information about which genes are affected, their effect sizes,
and the reliability of these findings.
}
\details{
Results are aggregated from multiple independent experiments. Key metrics:
\itemize{
  \item logfc_mean: Average log2 fold change across datasets
  \item n_datasets: Number of independent experiments supporting this relationship
  \item consistency_score: Fraction of datasets showing same direction (0.5-1.0)
  \item confidence: Evidence quality classification (see below)
}

Confidence levels indicate evidence strength:
\itemize{
  \item "high": 5+ datasets (reliable, reproducible finding)
  \item "medium": 2-4 datasets (moderate evidence)
  \item "low": 1 dataset (preliminary, needs validation)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# What happens when TP53 is knocked out?
result <- gpdb_what_happens("TP53")
cat(result$summary)

# In a specific cell line
result <- gpdb_what_happens("METTL3", context = list(cell_line = "K-562"))
}
}
