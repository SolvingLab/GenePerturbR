\title{Find Regulators of Target Gene}
\usage{
gpdb_find_regulators(
  target_gene,
  direction = c("any", "up", "down"),
  top_n = 50,
  min_datasets = 2,
  min_confidence = c("medium", "any", "high", "low"),
  return_separate = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_gene}{Character. Target gene symbol (e.g., "MYC", "TP53")}

\item{direction}{Character. Regulation direction:
\itemize{
  \item "up": Find genes whose knockdown INCREASES target (i.e., repressors of target)
  \item "down": Find genes whose knockdown DECREASES target (i.e., activators of target)
  \item "any": Find both types (default)
}}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of top regulators to return (default 50)}

\item{min_datasets}{Integer. Minimum number of independent datasets required (default 2).
Higher values give more reliable results but fewer candidates.}

\item{min_confidence}{Character. Filter by evidence strength:
\itemize{
  \item "high": n_datasets >= 5 (strong evidence, highly reliable)
  \item "medium": n_datasets >= 2 (moderate evidence, default)
  \item "low": n_datasets = 1 (single study, exploratory)
  \item "any": Include all levels
}}

\item{return_separate}{Logical. If TRUE and direction="any", return activators and repressors
as separate lists for clarity (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
Data frame or list with regulatory relationships
}
\description{
Identify genes that regulate the expression of a target gene when they are knocked out/down.
For example, if gene A knockdown causes gene B to increase, then A is a repressor of B.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# What regulates MYC? (returns separate lists)
regulators <- gpdb_find_regulators("MYC", top_n = 20)
regulators$repressors # Genes whose knockdown increases MYC
regulators$activators # Genes whose knockdown decreases MYC

# High confidence only
hc_regs <- gpdb_find_regulators("MYC", min_confidence = "high", top_n = 10)
}
