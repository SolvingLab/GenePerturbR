\title{Predict Drug Targets Based on Disease Signature}
\usage{
gpdb_predict_targets(
  disease_signature,
  mode = c("reverse", "mimic"),
  top_n = 10,
  min_confidence = "medium"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{disease_signature}{Data frame with two required columns:
\itemize{
  \item gene: Gene symbols
  \item logFC or direction: Either numeric log fold changes or "up"/"down" labels
}}

\item{mode}{Character. Analysis mode:
\itemize{
  \item "reverse": Find genes that produce OPPOSITE effects (for therapy, default)
    Example: If disease has high MYC, find genes whose knockdown reduces MYC
  \item "mimic": Find genes that produce SIMILAR effects (for mechanism study)
}}

\item{top_n}{Integer. Number of top candidate targets to return (default 10)}

\item{min_confidence}{Character. Minimum evidence quality:
\itemize{
  \item "high": Only use relationships from 5+ datasets (most reliable)
  \item "medium": Include relationships from 2+ datasets (default)
  \item "low": Include all data (exploratory)
}}
}
\value{
Data frame with candidate targets ranked by priority
}
\description{
Uses Gene Perturbation Similarity Analysis (GPSA) to identify candidate therapeutic targets.
The algorithm finds genes whose knockdown would reverse (or mimic) a disease gene expression signature.
}
\details{
Scoring Logic:
For each candidate gene, compute a weighted score based on how well it matches the signature:
\itemize{
  \item Match score: +1 if desired direction, -1 if opposite
  \item Weight factors: effect size × consistency × signature magnitude
  \item Total score: Sum across all signature genes
}

Higher scores indicate better candidates that affect more signature genes in the desired direction.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a disease signature
disease_sig <- data.frame(
  gene = c("MYC", "TP53", "KRAS"),
  logFC = c(2.5, -1.8, 3.2)
)

# Find genes that reverse this signature
targets <- gpdb_predict_targets(disease_sig, mode = "reverse")
}
}
